# Complete Java Basics to Advanced Topics & Subtopics


 
 1. Java Fundamentals

 Introduction

   History of Java
   JDK vs JRE vs JVM
   Installing Java and IDE setup (IntelliJ / Eclipse)

 Basic Syntax

   Structure of a Java program
   Main method signature (`public static void main(String[] args)`)
   Comments, whitespace, identifiers, keywords

 Data Types and Variables

   Primitive types (int, byte, short, long, float, double, char, boolean)
   Reference types (Objects, Arrays)
   Variable declaration, initialization, scope, lifetime
   Type casting (implicit, explicit)

 Operators

   Arithmetic (+, -, \, /, %)
   Assignment (=, +=, -=, etc.)
   Comparison (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
   Logical (&&, ||, !)
   Bitwise operators (optional but useful)

 Input/Output

   Using Scanner for input
   System.out.println, System.out.print
   Formatting output (printf)



 2. Control Flow

 Conditional Statements

   if, if-else
   else-if ladder
   switch-case (with break, default)

 Loops

   for loop
   while loop
   do-while loop
   Enhanced for-each loop (for arrays and collections)

 Jump Statements

   break
   continue
   return



 3. Methods (Functions)

 Defining methods
 Method parameters and return types
 Method overloading (same method name, different parameters)
 Recursion basics
 Variable arguments (`varargs`)
 Passing arguments (by value)
 Static methods



 4. Arrays

 Single dimensional arrays
 Multi-dimensional arrays
 Array initialization, default values
 Array traversal (loops)
 Common operations: search, insert, delete (manual)
 Arrays utility class (`Arrays.sort()`, `Arrays.toString()`)



 5. Strings and String Handling

 String basics and immutability
 String methods: length, charAt, substring, indexOf, contains, equals, equalsIgnoreCase, compareTo
 String concatenation (+ operator, StringBuilder/StringBuffer)
 StringBuilder vs StringBuffer (mutability and thread safety)
 Formatting strings



 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

 Classes and Objects

   Defining classes
   Creating objects
   Constructors (default and parameterized)
   `this` keyword
   Static vs instance variables and methods

 Encapsulation

   Private fields and public getter/setter methods
   Access modifiers: private, public, protected, default

 Inheritance

   `extends` keyword
   `super` keyword and constructor chaining
   Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)
   `final` keyword for methods and classes

 Polymorphism

   Compile-time (method overloading)
   Runtime (method overriding and dynamic method dispatch)
   Abstract classes and methods

 Interfaces

   Defining interfaces
   Implementing interfaces
   Default and static methods in interfaces (Java 8+)
   Functional interfaces and lambda basics

 Nested Classes

   Static nested classes
   Inner classes (non-static)
   Anonymous classes



 7. Exception Handling

 Types of exceptions (checked vs unchecked)
 Try-catch-finally blocks
 Multiple catch blocks
 Throwing exceptions with `throw`
 Creating custom exceptions
 Try-with-resources



 8. Java Collections Framework

 Collection interfaces: List, Set, Queue, Map
 Common implementations:

   List: ArrayList, LinkedList
   Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
   Map: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
   Queue: PriorityQueue, Deque
 Iterating collections (Iterator, enhanced for)
 Generics basics
 Comparable vs Comparator interfaces



 9. Advanced Java Concepts

 Java 8 Features

   Lambda expressions
   Streams API (filter, map, reduce)
   Functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier)
   Method references
   Optional class

 Multithreading Basics

   Thread creation (extends Thread, implements Runnable)
   Thread lifecycle and states
   Synchronization basics
   ExecutorService (optional for basics)

 File I/O

   Reading and writing files (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)
   Serialization basics



 10. Best Practices & Tooling

 Code readability and formatting
 Debugging basics in IDE
 Writing Javadoc comments
 Unit testing basics with JUnit (optional but recommended)



# How to Use This List?

 Start from #1 and cover all subtopics thoroughly
 For each subtopic, watch videos, read docs, and do coding problems
 Build mini-projects along the way to reinforce concepts
 Once you feel confident in a topic, move to the next one



# Recommended Practice Questions per Major Topic

 Basics + Loops: Print Patterns, Factorials, Sum of Digits, Fibonacci series
 Arrays: Find max/min, reverse array, frequency count, rotate array
 Strings: Palindrome check, Anagram check, substring search, count vowels
 OOP: Design classes for bank accounts, students, shapes (area/perimeter)
 Collections: Remove duplicates from list, frequency map, sorting objects
 Exception Handling: Build calculator with input validation and custom exceptions



# Mini Projects for Practice

 Calculator (basic + OOP version)
 Student Management System (CRUD in-memory)
 Library Book Management (using ArrayList)
 Simple Banking App with accounts and transactions
 Text Analyzer (count words, sentences, vowels, etc.)
