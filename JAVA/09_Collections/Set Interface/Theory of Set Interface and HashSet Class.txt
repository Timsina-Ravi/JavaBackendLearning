 Set Interface

The `Set` interface in Java is part of the Java Collections Framework and represents
 a collection of elements that do not allow duplicates. It extends the `Collection` interface
 and models a mathematical set. The key feature of a `Set` is that it ensures that no two
 elements are the same. The elements in a `Set` are unordered, meaning the order of elements
 is not guaranteed.

===============================================================

Use Case:
The `Set` interface is used to store unique elements without allowing duplicates. It is
ideal for tasks like maintaining unique user IDs, filtering duplicate data, and checking
if an element exists. Additionally, `Set` is useful for performing set operations such as
union, intersection, and difference between collections.

=================================================

Important methods in the `Set` interface:
- `add(E e)`: Adds the specified element to the set. If the element is already present, it
 doesn't add it (returns `false`).
- `remove(Object o)`: Removes the specified element from the set, if present.
- `contains(Object o)`: Checks if the set contains the specified element.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the set.
- `isEmpty()`: Returns `true` if the set contains no elements.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the set.
- `iterator()`: Returns an iterator over the elements in the set.

=====================================

 HashSet

`HashSet` is a concrete implementation of the `Set` interface backed by a hash table.
 It stores elements in a way that allows fast insertion, removal, and lookup. `HashSet`
 does not maintain any order of elements, and duplicates are not allowed.

Unique or Important Methods in `HashSet`:
- `clone()`: Returns a shallow copy of the `HashSet` (useful if you need to copy the set
 without altering the original).

=======================================================

Use Case:

`HashSet` is ideal for scenarios where you need a high-performance collection for storing
 unique elements without caring about the order.
  It is often used for tasks like:
- Removing duplicates from a collection.
- Storing unique identifiers (e.g., user IDs or transaction IDs).
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
