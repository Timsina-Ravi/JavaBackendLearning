 1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

 1.1. JDBC Basics
- What is JDBC?
  - Understanding how JDBC connects Java applications to databases.
  
- JDBC Drivers:
  - Types of JDBC drivers (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4).
  - Downloading and adding the necessary JDBC driver for the database you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

 1.2. Establishing a Database Connection
- Connection Object:
  - Using `DriverManager` to establish a connection.
  - `Connection` interface and how to close it properly.

  Example:
  
  Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb", "username", "password");
  
==========================================================================================

 1.3. Working with Statements
- Creating and Using Statements:
  - `Statement` vs. `PreparedStatement`.
  - Execute simple queries like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

  Example:
  
  Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM students");
  

- PreparedStatement:
  - Why use `PreparedStatement` over `Statement` (SQL injection prevention).
  - Example of parameterized queries.

  Example:
  
  PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = ?");
  pstmt.setString(1, "John");
  ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
  
===============================================================================================

 1.4. Handling Results
- ResultSet:
  - Iterating through the `ResultSet` to retrieve data.

  Example:
  
  while(rs.next()) {
      System.out.println(rs.getString("name"));
  }
  

 1.5. Exception Handling
- SQLException:
  - How to handle SQLExceptions during database operations.

  Example:
  
  try {
      Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
      stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('John')");
  } catch (SQLException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  

 1.6. Closing Resources
- Closing Connections, Statements, and ResultSets:
  - Using `finally` block to ensure resources are always closed.

  Example:
  
  if (rs != null) rs.close();
  if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
  if (connection != null) connection.close();
  
=======================================================================================

 1.7. Transactions (Optional for now)
- Committing and Rolling Back:
  - Using `commit()` and `rollback()` for transaction management.

  Example:
  
  connection.setAutoCommit(false);
  // Perform queries
  connection.commit(); // or connection.rollback();

 2. Databases (Relational Database Basics)

 2.1. SQL Basics
- SQL Queries:
  - SELECT: Retrieving data from tables.
    - `SELECT * FROM students;`
  - INSERT: Adding new records to a table.
    - `INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25);`
  - UPDATE: Modifying existing records.
    - `UPDATE students SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'John';`
  - DELETE: Removing records from a table.
    - `DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'John';`

 2.2. Filtering Data
- WHERE Clause:
  - Filtering results with conditions.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;`

- ORDER BY:
  - Sorting data based on columns.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;`

 2.3. Database Design Basics
- Tables:
  - What is a table, and how to create a simple table with SQL.
  - Example:
  sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      age INT
  );
  

- Primary Keys:
  - Understanding how primary keys are used to uniquely identify each record.

- Foreign Keys:
  - Defining relationships between tables (e.g., linking a `student` to a `class`).

 2.4. SQL Joins
- INNER JOIN:
  - Combining rows from two tables based on a matching column.
  - Example:
  sql
  SELECT students.name, classes.name 
  FROM students
  INNER JOIN classes ON students.class_id = classes.id;
  

- LEFT JOIN:
  - Retrieving all records from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

 2.5. SQL Aggregation
- GROUP BY:
  - Grouping data based on a column (e.g., grouping students by class).
  - Example:
  sql
  SELECT class_id, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY class_id;
  

- Aggregate Functions:
  - COUNT: Counting rows.
  - SUM: Summing values in a column.
  - AVG: Calculating average.

  Example:
  sql
  SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
  

 2.6. Data Integrity
- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT Constraints:
  - Ensuring data validity.
  - Example:
  sql
  CREATE TABLE students (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      age INT DEFAULT 18
  );

 Practice Tasks and Projects:

1. JDBC Tasks:
   - Create a JDBC-based application for adding, displaying, updating, and deleting records from a `students` table.
   - Handle SQLExceptions and close resources properly.
   - Write a program that inserts records into a `students` table and displays them.

2. SQL Practice:
   - Create a database and tables (e.g., `students`, `courses`, `enrollments`).
   - Perform basic SQL operations: Select, insert, update, delete records.
   - Write queries using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`).
   - Practice JOINs by combining data from multiple tables.

3. Database Design:
   - Create a simple relational database schema that includes primary and foreign keys.
   - Model a real-world problem like a library management system or student enrollment system using tables with foreign key relationships.



 Resources for Learning:
- Books: "Head First Java" (covers JDBC), "Java Persistence with Hibernate" (for JPA).
- Websites: SQLZoo, W3Schools, Java official docs.
- Tools: Install MySQL/PostgreSQL and use a simple IDE like IntelliJ IDEA to run your JDBC programs.
