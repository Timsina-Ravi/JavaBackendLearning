/*

 âœ… 1. Product Inventory API
Objective:
Build an API to manage different product types with varying pricing logic.
Concepts Covered:
- Abstraction via abstract class for `Product`
- Inheritance with `Electronics` and `Grocery`
- Polymorphism via method overriding
- Encapsulation in product fields
- Interface for price calculation
- Use `ArrayList<Product>` as storage

Endpoints:
1. Add an electronics product
2. Add a grocery product
3. Get all products
4. Get product and its price by ID
5. Update product name
6. Delete a product
